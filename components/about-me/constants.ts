export const myStory = `
    After the war in Gaza and the closure of universities, I took the opportunity to begin learning the fundamentals of web development — starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I built several projects using vanilla JavaScript, which helped me understand the core of how the web works.
    As I looked for the next step, I discovered a training opportunity with Gaza Sky Geeks focused on React and Next.js. I applied, passed the interview, and was accepted. During this intensive program, my team and I built a project called Codepilot, which won first place in the final demo phase.
    After graduating, I focused on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and building more projects using both React and Next.js. Driven to grow as a full-stack developer, I applied to the Gaza Sky Geeks Backend Bootcamp, where I was accepted after a competitive multi-stage selection process.
    Now, I’m continuing to expand my skill set by learning React Native while exploring backend technologies — on a mission to become a well-rounded software engineer.
